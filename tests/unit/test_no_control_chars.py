"""No literal control characters in source. This bug has shipped four times.

A `\b` written through a shell heredoc becomes a literal backspace (0x08).
The regex still compiles, the code still runs, the tests still pass -- and the
pattern can never match, so the feature is silently dead.

History in this repo:
  #145  guard_mock's raises-detection regex
  #170  the control-flow-exit suppressor
  #173  boundary injection targeting
  #174  _apply_guard_mock -- shipped inside the PR that was fixing #173's
        instance, and left rung 3's MagicMock branch unreachable

Every one passed CI. A grep is the only thing that catches this class, so it
lives in the suite rather than in a workflow step where it can be skipped.
